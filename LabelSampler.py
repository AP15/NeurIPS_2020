class LabelSampler:
    """
    Takes labeled samples in a pipeline fashion.

    This class supports sampling u.a.r. from a specified dataset until one of the labels
    has enough samples (specified by a threshold) at which point samples are returned.
    The dataset is passed at every sampling call, and the sampler drops any old samples that
    are not in the specified dataset.

    Examples
    --------
    # 10 points, 2 classes, 3 samples each round
    X = pd.DataFrame({'label': np.random.randint(2,size=10)})
